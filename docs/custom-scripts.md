## Executing your own scripts

This will only work for containers using `s6 overlay`, recognisable by `ENVIRONMENT` printed at the top of the log when the container starts.

If you have a need to do additional stuff when the container starts or stops, you can mount your script with the volume `/docker/host/my-script.sh:/etc/cont-init.d/99-my-script` to execute your script on container start or `/docker/host/my-script.sh:/etc/cont-finish.d/99-my-script` to execute it when the container stops. An example script can be seen below.

```shell
#!/usr/bin/with-contenv bash

echo "Hello, this is me, your script."
```
